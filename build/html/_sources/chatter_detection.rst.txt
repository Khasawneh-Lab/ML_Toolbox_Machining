Chatter Detection Module Documentation
======================================

This toolbox includes the documentation for the Python codes that extract features by using Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT)
and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and diagnose chatter in turning process for different cutting configurations. Algorithms are based on the methods 
explained in :cite:`1 <Yesilli2019>`. The experimental data in both raw and processed format can be found in Mendeley repository :cite:`Khasawneh2019`. Python and MATLAB codes are available in 
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/mcanyesilli/WPT_EEMD_ML_Machining>`_.
