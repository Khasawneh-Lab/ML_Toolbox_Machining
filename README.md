# Machine Learning Toolbox for Machining
This toolbox includes the documentation for the Python codes used to diagnose chatter in machining applications. 
Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), Ensemble Emprical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are the approaches included in this repository. Please see the references below for more details about the approaches. 

The experimental data in both raw and processed format can be found in [Mendeley repository](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hvm4wh3jzx/1).

Sphinx documentation for this toolbox is available in this [link](http://firaskhasawneh.com/assets/repo_docs/ML_WPT_EEMD_doc/index.html).
